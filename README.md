This project was inspired by the playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrsle5quS7A&list=PL55RiY5tL51rrC3sh8qLiYHqUV3twEYU_

And the code at https://github.com/mschwarzmueller/reactjs-redux-basics

In my version of this app, I make an AJAX request to a PHP file that gives me a random number, ever 3 seconds. This is done to simulate a self-updating stock ticker.

If you are checking out this repository for the first time you may need to run the following command to create the node_modules directory:
Please note, I don't use Create React App. I instead configured webpack and eslint manually. 

npm install


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:
npm run start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
